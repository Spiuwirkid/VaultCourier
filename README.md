## **How to Create a Telegram Bot and Get Chat ID** 🔧

### **Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot**
1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**.
2. Start a chat with BotFather and send the command:
   ```
   /newbot
   ```
3. Follow the instructions to:
   - Give your bot a name (e.g., `VaultCourierBot`).
   - Create a unique username for the bot (e.g., `VaultCourier_Bot`).
